Since the program is designed to indefinitely listen for key strokes until terminated in order to serve its purpose, the consumption of resources (CPU) has also been minimized and optimized; so the program can be left running in the background for as long as required, or even be scheduled to run automatically at every system start (by placing MacroNinja (Headless).pyw in the **\Users\<YOUR USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup** directory) without any prominent CPU usage.

This project was created in Python and has both versions — headless (will run in the background) and windowed (will have a window with a macro-key guide open).

**Dependencies you may have to "pip install" before being able to run the Python file(s):**

**keyboard** (for keyboard control/listening)
